## NOTES


- How to determine maximum batch size?
- What are the indications that training is going well or badly?
- Is there any down side to my approach with validation script?
- How would i incorporate some hdf5 saving into my workflow?

#OVERFITTING
- You will notice if training accuracy is much higher than validation


#T1
- After 13 epochs accuracy stops improving
- Accuracy is very low (0.362)
- After 2nd epoch validation accuracy freezes at 0.3360
- during training the accuracy seemed much higher (~80) but the summaries tell a different story
